    "questions": "1. What programming language, originally developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, is known for its use in developing operating systems like Unix and remains widely used in system-level programming?  \n\n2. In object-oriented programming, what term describes the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance, often summarized by the phrase \"one interface, multiple implementations\"?  \n\n3. Which data structure, characterized by its \"last-in, first-out\" (LIFO) behavior, is commonly used for managing function calls and execution contexts in most programming languages?  \n\n4. What fundamental algorithm, named after a British mathematician, is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph and is a staple in computer science and network routing protocols?",
    "answers": "1) java\n2) inheritance\n3) stack\n4) idk",
    "result": "Let's check each answer:  \n\n1. **Your answer:** java  \n   **Correct answer:** C  \n   *Explanation:* The language originally developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s for Unix is **C**, not Java.  \n\n2. **Your answer:** inheritance  \n   **Correct answer:** polymorphism  \n   *Explanation:* Inheritance is the mechanism, but the term describing \"one interface, multiple implementations\" is **polymorphism**.  \n\n3. **Your answer:** stack  \n   **Correct answer:** stack ✅  \n   *Explanation:* A stack has LIFO behavior and is used for managing function calls and execution contexts.  \n\n4. **Your answer:** idk  \n   **Correct answer:** Dijkstra's algorithm  \n   *Explanation:* The algorithm named after the Dutch computer scientist **Edsger Dijkstra** is used to find the shortest path in a graph.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n1. ❌ Correct answer: **C**  \n2. ❌ Correct answer: **polymorphism**  \n3. ✅ Correct  \n4. ❌ Correct answer: **Dijkstra's algorithm**",
