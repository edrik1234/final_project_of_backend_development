Correct answer is **Java**.\n\n**Question 2:**  \n*In web development, what does the acronym CSS stand for?*  \n- **Answer given:** PHPH (doesn’t match CSS acronym)  \n- **Correct answer:** Cascading Style Sheets  \n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. Correct answer is **Cascading Style Sheets**.\n\n**Question 3:**  \n*Which data structure operates on a \"first in, first out\" (FIFO) principle?*  \n- **Answer given:** PYTHON (Python is a language, not a data structure)  \n- **Correct answer:** Queue  \n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.

    "result": "Let’s check each one:  \n\n1. **Oak** was the original name for **Java** (released 1995), so the answer should be **Java**, not `js` (JavaScript).  \n   → **Incorrect**. Correct answer: **Java**.\n\n2. **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, so `css` is correct.  \n   → **Correct**.\n\n3. Git uses the **SHA-1** hash algorithm for tracking changes, but the question asks for the *name of the algorithm* — often called the **SHA-1 hashing algorithm**.  \n   `python` is wrong here.  \n   → **Incorrect**. Correct answer: **SHA-1** (or **Secure Hash Algorithm 1**).\n\n4. The paradigm associated with pure functions and immutable data is **functional programming**.  \n   `xs` is not a recognized programming paradigm.  \n   → **Incorrect**.
