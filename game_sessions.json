    "result": "Let’s check each answer:  \n\n1. **Your answer:** `java`  \n   **Question:** Which programming language, first released in 1995, was originally named Oak after an oak tree outside its creator's office?  \n   ✅ **Correct.** Java was originally named Oak.  \n\n2. **Your answer:** `cascading style sheets`  \n   **Question:** In web development, what does the acronym CSS stand for?  \n   ✅ **Correct.** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  \n\n3. **Your answer:** `ci/cd`  \n   **Question:** What is the name of the algorithm used by Git for tracking changes in source code during software development?  \n   ❌ **Incorrect.** CI/CD refers to Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, not the Git change-tracking algorithm.  \n   **Correct answer:** Git uses the **SHA-1 hash algorithm** for tracking changes, but the core method for tracking changes is based on a **content-addressable filesystem** and **snapshot-based tracking**, not a single named algorithm like \"diff.\" However, the most precise answer to the question as commonly asked is **SHA-1** (though Git is moving toward SHA-256).  \n\n4. **Your answer:** `def`  \n   **Question:** In Python, what keyword is used to define a function?  \n   ✅ **Correct.** In Python, `def` is used to define a function.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n1. ✅ Correct  \n2. ✅ Correct  \n3. ❌ Incorrect — correct answer is **SHA-1** (for Git’s change tracking)  \n4. ✅ Correct",
