Correct answer is **Java**.\n\n**Question 2:**  \n*In web development, what does the acronym CSS stand for?*  \n- **Answer given:** PHPH (doesn’t match CSS acronym)  \n- **Correct answer:** Cascading Style Sheets  \n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. Correct answer is **Cascading Style Sheets**.\n\n**Question 3:**  \n*Which data structure operates on a \"first in, first out\" (FIFO) principle?*  \n- **Answer given:** PYTHON (Python is a language, not a data structure)  \n- **Correct answer:** Queue  \n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.

    "result": "Let’s check each one:  \n\n1. **Oak** was the original name for **Java** (released 1995), so the answer should be **Java**, not `js` (JavaScript).  \n   → **Incorrect**. Correct answer: **Java**.\n\n2. **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, so `css` is correct.  \n   → **Correct**.\n\n3. Git uses the **SHA-1** hash algorithm for tracking changes, but the question asks for the *name of the algorithm* — often called the **SHA-1 hashing algorithm**.  \n   `python` is wrong here.  \n   → **Incorrect**. Correct answer: **SHA-1** (or **Secure Hash Algorithm 1**).\n\n4. The paradigm associated with pure functions and immutable data is **functional programming**.  \n   `xs` is not a recognized programming paradigm.  \n   → **Incorrect**.

    "result": "Let's check each answer:  \n\n1. **JS** → The language originally named Oak is **Java**, not JavaScript. So this is incorrect.  \n   ✅ Correct answer: **Java**  \n\n2. **YTHON** → This seems like a misspelling of **Python**, but the question is about a function that calls itself — that’s **recursion** (or a recursive function), not a programming language name. So this is incorrect.  \n   ✅ Correct answer: **Recursion**  \n\n3. **CSS** → This matches the acronym in the question, and CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. So this is correct.  \n   ✅ Correct answer: **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets)  \n\n4. **XSDSD** → This doesn’t match any known data structure. The FIFO data structure is a **queue**.
